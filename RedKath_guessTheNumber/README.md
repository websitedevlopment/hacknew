# Guess the Number Game (Python)

The game works like this:

  -  You choose a level: 1 (25 chances), 2 (15 chances), 3 (5 chances)
  -  The game will randomly pick a number from 1 to 1000
  -  In every turn, you pick a number
  -  The game will always tell you if your guess was lower or higher than the right number
  -  You win if you guess the right number before you run out of chances
  -  The game saves the highest score in a file named "score.txt".

## How to Run the Python script
1. Go to GuessTheNumberGame directory. In your terminal, assuming that you are inside the awesome-projects directory
`cd GuessTheNumberGame `
2. Run the script using the command `py main.py`.
3. Have fun playing!
